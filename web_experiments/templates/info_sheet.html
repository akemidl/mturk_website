<p>As a participant in our experiment, you have filled out several questionnaires thatgive us a measure of your current and general mood state. Both depression andanxiety are important concerns in our society, with one in three of us suffering fromclinical levels of anxiety or depression in our lifetimes. Beyond that, many of us willstruggle with some symptoms of anxiety or depression at one point or another. In caseyou are currently struggling with feeling down or anxious, we have put together thisinformation sheet to give you some information regarding whom you can contact.</p>

<p><strong>For everyone:</strong></p>
<p>You are very welcome to contact the study PI Professor Sonia Bishop(sbishop@berkeley.edu) who can provide you with further information beyond thatbelow. We would especially encourage you to do this if you have any concerns thathave arisen as a result of taking part in this study. You can also call the Bishop lab on(510) 642-2746.</p>


<p><strong>If you are in crisis </strong> and need immediate support or intervention, call, or go the websiteof the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255). Trained crisis workersare available to talk 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<p><strong>UC Berkeley Students:</strong></p>
<p>The University Health Services has several services for people seeking help.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can visit the website to know more about clinical depression and toidentify the signs of it: www.uhs.berkeley.edu/lookforthesigns</li>
<li> You can also take a confidential screening: If you are unsure whether you aresuffering from clinical depression, an anxiety disorder, or other mental healthissues or, if you are uncertain whether to seek professional help, considertaking a confidential on-line screening. Visit the University Health Serviceswebsite (www.uhs.berkeley.edu) and go to Student Services (A to Z). Lookunder Self-Help: Mental Health Resources.</li>
<li> You can schedule a free, confidential appointment with a Counselingand Psychological Services (CPS) counselor by calling (510) 642-9494.</li>
</ul>

<p>CPS location: Tang Center, 3rd floor, room 3300 2222 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, CA94720</p>

<p><strong>Non-Students:</strong></p>
<p>The best first course of action is to go to your PCP and say that you have beenexperiencing some symptoms of anxiety and/or depression recently. They may askyou to fill in some questionnaires similar to ones that we have used here and can alsodiscuss both psychotherapy (e.g. counseling) and medication options with you.</p>

<p> An alternative resource for those who live in the area is the UC Berkeley PsychologyClinic. The clinic contact details are given below: </p>

<p>2205 Tolman Hall</p><p>University of California</p><p>Berkeley, CA 94720-1650</p><p>Telephone: (510) 642-2055 || Fax: (510) 643-1922</p><p>Open: Monday â€“ Friday, 9:00 to 5:00</p>
