Uncertainty stops me from having a firm opinion
Being uncertain means that a person is disorganized
Uncertainty makes life intolerable
It's unfair not having any guarantees in life.
My mind can't be relaxed if I don't know what will happen tomorrow. 
Uncertainty makes me uneasy, anxious, or stressed. 
Unforeseen events upset me greatly. 
It frustrates me not having all the information I need.
Uncertainty keeps me from living a full life.
One should always look ahead so as to avoid surprises. 
A small unforeseen event can spoil everything, even with the best of planning. 
When it's time to act, uncertainty paralyses me. 
Being uncertain means that I am not first rate
When I am uncertain, I can't go forward
When I am uncertain I can't function very well
Unlike me, others always seem to know where they are going with their lives
Uncertainty makes me vulnerable, unhappy, or sad
I always want to know what the future has in store for me
I can't stand being taken by surprise
The smallest doubt can stop me from acting
I should be able to organize everything in advance
Being uncertain means that I lack confidence
I think it's unfair that other people seem sure about their future
Uncertainty keeps me from sleeping soundly
I must get away from all uncertain situations.
The ambiguities in life stress me
I can't stand being undecided about my future
