I was bothered by things that usually donâ€™t bother me
I did not feel like eating; my appetite was poor
I felt that I could not shake off the blues even with help from my family
I felt that I was just as good as other people
I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing
I felt depressed
I felt that everything I did was an effort
I felt hopeful about the future
I thought my life had been a failure
I felt fearful
My sleep was restless
I was happy
I talked less than usual
I felt lonely
People were unfriendly
I enjoyed life
I had crying spells
I felt sad
I felt that people disliked me
I could not "get going"
