I feel pleasant 
I fel nervous and restless
I feel satisfied with myself
I wish I could be as happy as others seem to be
I feel like a failure
I feel rested
I am calm, cool, and collected
I feel that difficulties are piling up so that I cannot overcome them
I worry too much over something that really doesn’t matter
I am happy
I have disturbing thoughts
I lack self-confidence
I feel secure
I make decisions easily 
I feel inadequate
I am content
Some unimportant thought runs through my mind and bothers me
I take disappointments so keenly that I can’t put them out of my mind
I am a steady person
I get in a state of tension or turmoil as I think over my recent concerns and interest
