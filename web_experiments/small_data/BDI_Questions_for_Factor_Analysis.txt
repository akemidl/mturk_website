I am so sad or unhappy that I cant stand it
I feel that the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve
I feel I am a complete failure as a person
I am dissatisfied or bored with everything
I feel guilty all of the time
I feel I am being punished
I hate myself
I blame myself for everything bad that happens
I would kill myself if I had the chance
I used to be able to cry, but now I cant cry even though I want to
I dont get irritated at all by the things that used to irritate me
I have lost all of my interest in other people
I cant make decisions at all anymore
I believe that I look ugly
I cant do any work at all
I wake up several hours earlier than I used to and cannot get back to sleep
I am tired too tired to do anything
I have no appetite at all anymore
I have lost more than 15 pounds
I am so worried about my physical problems that I cannot think about anything else
I have lost interest in sex completely
