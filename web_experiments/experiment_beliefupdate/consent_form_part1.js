"<p>My name is Professor Sonia Bishop. I am a faculty member in the Psychology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. I invite you to take part in a research study. This study investigates how individuals with varying personality traits, cognitive styles and current mood states make decisions and process feedback when dealing with real-world style situations.</p>"+

"<p> This study has three parts. The first part lasts about an hour and involves completing questionnaires about your personality, mood and thinking style and answering questions that will be used to construct a profile for a hypothetical internship. Specifically, we will ask you about your working style, and to provide other information (a short description of what you could bring to the internship, course grades and SAT scores) that we will make into a profile to be shown to other"+ " participants in Parts 2 and 3. Parts 2 and 3 will also each take about an hour. In Part 2, all participants, including yourself, will be shown pairs of profiles. The task will be to choose one person from each pair that would make a good team member for the hypothetical internship. In Part 3, we will select a number of pairings in which your profile was included and give you feedback about whether or not you were chosen. You will be able to choose if you would like to receive additional"+ " feedback, once the study is completed, on the parts of the profile that participants tended to use to influence their choices. You can also choose at the end of Part 3 if you want to know your exact ranking.  Names will not be linked to profiles and in Part 3 (where feedback is given) the free-response section of other participants’ profiles will not be included. </p>"+

"<p>We are asking you to take part in the Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3. We would greatly appreciate it if you would do all three sessions but you are free to choose to participate in none, one, two, or all three. You can withdraw consent at any time.</p>"+

"<div><u>Procedures</u></div>"+
"<ul >"+
"<li>	You can sign up to this experiment online through ‘RPP’ for course credit or through ‘RSVP’ for reimbursement. <u>We ask you to indicate you have read this form and consent to take part by clicking the ‘I agree’ button next to the statement ‘I consent to participate in Part 1 of this research study’.</u> You cannot continue with the experiment without doing this. If you choose not to participate it will in no way affect your eligibility for other RPP or RSVP experiments.</li>"+
"<li> This part (Part 1) of this study will take place online and typically takes 30 minutes, but will last no more than 1 hour</li>"+
"<li> We will ask you to complete several questionnaires that aim to assess mood, personality, and/or cognitive style.</li>"+
"<li> We will also ask you to provide details about your SAT scores, 3 grades, answers to some questions about your work style, such as whether you prefer to work in groups or on their own, and a free-style answer to why you would be a good team member for a hypothetical team project. </li>"+
"<li> As we are interested in individual differences in emotional and cognitive function, sometimes we are looking for people with a score in a given range for one or more of our measures of mood, personality, and cognitive style. Your scores on these measures may determine whether we ask you to participate in Parts 2-3 of the current study. If we do not, we can try to find another experiment for you to participate in if you would like that</li>"+
"<li> We will also ask you to answer a series of questions regarding your current and past history of psychiatric health. Your answers here may also influence whether you are eligible to take part in Parts 2-3.</li>"+
"</ul>"+

"<div><u>Risks/Discomforts</u></div>"+
"<p>There is a possibility that you may find some of the mood, personality, cognitive style or psychiatric history questions disturbing. You are free to withdraw and to discontinue your participation in the study at any point. You are also free to choose not to answer any of the questions. As some of the questions are used to determine eligibility for Parts 2-3, choosing not to answer certain questions may affect your eligibility for Parts 2-3 but it will in no other way impact your relationship with the University or ability to take part in subsequent experiments.</p>"+
