"<p>My name is Professor Sonia Bishop. I am a faculty member in the Psychology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. I invite you to take part in a research study. This is the second part of a three-part study investigating how individuals with varying personality traits, cognitive styles and current mood states make decisions and process feedback when dealing with real-world style situations.</p>"+

"<p>You have already taken part in Part 1 which involved answering questions that were used to construct a profile for a hypothetical internship and completing questionnaires about your personality, mood and/or thinking style and answering questions that were used to construct a profile for a hypothetical internship. Now we invite you to participate in the second part of the study which will involve seeing the profiles of other participants from Part 1 and choosing who you think would make good team partners for the hypothetical internship project. We also have a few further questionnaires about personality, mood and/or thinking style we would ask you to complete.</p>"+

"<div><u>Procedures</u></div>"+
"<ul >"+
"<li>	You can sign up to this experiment online through ‘RPP’ for course credit or through ‘RSVP’ for reimbursement. We ask you to indicate you have read this form and consent to take part by clicking the ‘I agree’ button next to the statement ‘I consent to participate in Part 2 of this research study’. You cannot continue with the experiment without doing this. If you choose not to participate it will in no way affect your eligibility for other RPP or RSVP experiments.</li>"+
"<li> This part (Part 2) of this study will take place online and will last no more than 1 hour.</li>"+
"<li> In this session, you will see the profiles of other participants from Part 1. These profiles will be presented in pairs, and you will choose one person in each pair whom you’d think would make a good team member for the hypothetical internship project. </li>"+
"<li> In addition, we will ask you to complete several additional questionnaires assessing mood, personality, and/or cognitive style. </li>"+
"<li> As we are interested in the effects of individual differences in mood, personality and cognitive style on decision-making, sometimes we are looking for people with a score in a given range on one or more of these questionnaires. Your scores on these questionnaires may determine whether we ask you to participate in Part 3 of the current study. If we do not, we can try to find another experiment for you to participate in if you would like that.</li>"+
"</ul>"+

"<div><u>Risks/Discomforts</u></div>"+
"<p>There are no significant hazards or risks associated with participation in this part of the study. There is a small possibility that you may find some of the questionnaire items upsetting. You are free to withdraw and to discontinue your participation in the study at any point. If you chose to withdraw after commencing you will still be paid fully/receive full course credits for this session. You are also free to choose not to answer any of the questions. As some of the questions are used to determine eligibility for Part 3, choosing not to answer certain questions may affect your eligibility for Part 3 but it will in no other way impact your relationship with the University or ability to take part in subsequent experiments.</p>"+

"<div><u>Confidentiality</u></div>"+
"<p>Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used. Though there is a risk that confidentiality could be compromised, we take care to preserve the confidentiality of your data.</p>"+
"<p>If you completed Part 1 of this study before today, you may have given us permission to use a key to link your ID code to your name and contact details for the sake of Parts 2 and 3 of this study and potentially other future experiments. This key is encrypted and stored on a password protected computer. You can ask to have this key destroyed at any point. Study data identified by your ID code alone will be kept in separate, locked files, and ID coded electronic data will be kept on a password-secured computer. Your data will be securely stored for 10 years and then destroyed.</p>"+
"<p>We will also use some of the choices you make in Part 2 to give feedback to other participants in Part 3. The participant receiving the feedback will not be told who each piece of feedback they receive was provided by and your name will not be used at any point.</p>"+

"<div><u>Payment</u></div>"+
"<p>If you are recruited through RPP, you will receive course credit for your participation upon successful completion of your Part 2 session. Based on the Psychology departments’ criteria, you will receive 0.5 credit for completion of Part 2. If you were recruited through RSVP, you will receive $5 upon completion of Part 2. In order to be paid, you will need to provide us with your Venmo username, which you can enter into a text box at the end of Part 2. We will not link this username to any of your data. If you are invited and choose to participate in Part 3, you will receive payment for this session.</p>"+

"<div><u>Questions</u></div>"+
"<p>If you have any questions about this research, please email Professor Sonia Bishop, at sbishop@berkeley.edu or contact the research group at affectivecogneurolab@gmail.com. If you have any questions about your rights or treatment as a participant in this research project, please contact the University of California at Berkeley’s Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at 510-642-7461 or subjects@berkeley.edu.</p>"+
"<p>PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH IS VOLUNTARY. You are free to choose not to take part, or you may terminate your participation in the experiment at any time. There will be no penalty to you or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled if you refuse to participate or terminate participation.</p>"+
